# Project Statement

**Problem statement:** Many remote or low-connectivity environments cannot access live weather APIs. Students must build an offline-capable tool that analyzes historical/local weather CSV files to extract insights and provide basic predictions without relying on online services.

**Scope:** Build a Python-only project that reads local CSV weather datasets, performs cleaning, analysis, visualization (saved to files), and contains a simple prediction module that is runnable when scikit-learn is available.

**Target users:** Students, researchers, local administrators in remote areas, and hobbyists who need offline weather analytics.

**High-level features:**
- Local CSV ingestion
- Data cleaning and validation
- Summary analytics (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Visualization exports (PNG)
- Basic ML prediction module (optional dependency)
- CLI for ease of use
